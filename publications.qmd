## Instructions for Adding Publications

### Using BibTeX (Recommended)

Add new entries to `references.bib` in BibTeX format, then cite them on this page using `[@citation-key]`. Quarto will automatically render the full bibliography at the bottom of the page.

Example BibTeX entry:
```bibtex
@article{key2024,
  title = {Your Publication Title},
  author = {Author1 and Author2},
  journal = {Journal Name},
  year = {2024},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {1--10},
  doi = {10.1000/xyz123}
}
```

Then cite it in the appropriate year section:
```markdown
- [@key2024]
```

### Using ORCID (Advanced)

To automatically sync publications from ORCID:

1. Obtain your ORCID ID from https://orcid.org
2. Use the ORCID Public API to fetch publications
3. Create a script to convert ORCID data to BibTeX format
4. Add the script to your GitHub Actions workflow

Example approach:
- Python: Use `requests` to query ORCID API, `pybtex` to format BibTeX
- R: Use `rorcid` package

See the README for more detailed instructions.
